# OpenExoAmp
Bio-signal Amplifier

### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of this project is to develop a bio-signal amplifier for sensing physiological signals.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> Block diagram of an amplifier (OpenExoAmp) for bio-signal amplification and filtering. The amplifier is built with commercially-off-the-shelf components and powered by a pair of batteries. A pre-amplifier section with high common-mode-rejection-ratio (CMRR) is used to differencially pick the bio-signal. If differential input is not required, the inverting input can be shorted with the input reference terminal. The signal is then band-passed filtered and amplified with a programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The the gain of the PGA is controlled by a microcontroller (MCU). The final signal is then digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and transfered through serial network (USB).
