# OpenExoAmp
Open Source Bio-signal Amplifier

### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of this project is to develop an wireless bio-signal amplifier for sensing physiological signals.

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> Block diagram of an open sournce amplifier (OpenExoAmp) for bio-signal filtering and amplification. The amplifier is built with commercially-off-the-shelf components and powered by a pair of batteries. A notch-filter allows to filter out the line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) noise. The band-passed filtered signal is amplified and digitized by an ADC with integrated PGA before sending through serial network.
